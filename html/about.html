                <h1>Hello There</h1>
                <h2>Here is more about what I am and what I do: <br> </h2>
                   <h3>My full name is Taflynne Summer Petersen , age 18. <br> Matriculated in 2022 at Muizenberg High School.
                    To describe who I am in one word is introspective. I am observant and I examine things. However I am talented and creative too.<br>
                    I am a musician , I play guitar and bass guitar as well as alto singing. These i would say are skills as i have been tested for them.<br>
                    Some of my favourite hobbies include: baking, reading, basketball and photography. 
                    <br>
                    How I started to enjoy and grow a love for coding, is through my ex-bestfriend and for the love of technology. I was always intrigued by Web development and the work that goes into.
                    To understand what is being done and how everything relates. This was my starting point of drawing closer to the industry as a whole.

    <h1>Work Experience</h1>
  
     <h2>Here is a brief description of my previous work experience:</h2><br>
      <h3>
  During covid I received my first job oppotunity to babysitt for a couple who were at the time essential workers.
  I worked for them through out the whole lockdown restrictions. For more information,for a detailed experience please download my CV down below.
  In my matric year I worked my first formal job at Silver Mountain Spur,there I worked as a hostess, my main responsibility was to seat people and be front of house.<
  However, when I needed to do something extra I was always open to do so. Currently I am working a part-time job which is on contract as a retailer in a deli.
